## What is PortDesk?

PortDesk turns any device into a full PC controller over your local network (WiFi or USB).  
No installation needed — just open a URL in any browser.  
Everything runs **locally on your machine**. Nothing is sent to the internet. Ever.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pyautogui opencv-python mss psutil pyperclip sounddevice numpy Pillow python-multipart
```

**Optional (for better performance):**
```bash
pip install dxcam          # Windows only — faster screen capture via DirectX
pip install PyTurboJPEG    # faster JPEG encoding
pip install aiortc         # WebRTC support
pip install cryptography   # for HTTPS/SSL
```

### 2. Run the server

# (recomended) run it by start file

or
```bash
python portdesk-server.py
```

You'll see something like:
```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  🎮 PortDesk v1.0
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  [USB]  adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000 → http://localhost:5000
  [WiFi] http://192.168.1.x:5000
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 3. Open on any device

- **WiFi mode:** Open `http://192.168.1.x:5000` in any browser on any device on the same network
** Open the IP shown in the terminal on any browser and it Works from phones, tablets, laptops, other PCs — anything with a browser
## notice !!
you have to Connect your device and PC to the same WiFi network . not guest network either data.

- **USB (Android) mode:** Enable USB Debugging on your Android device first, then Run `adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000` then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

## notice !!
**Requires [ADB (Android Debug Bridge)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) installed on PC.**
  > For non-Android devices (iPhone, iPad, laptop) just use WiFi mode — USB mode is Android-specific.  

- **Hotspot Mode** (no router needed)
You can use PortDesk without any WiFi router by creating a hotspot directly from your PC.

**Windows:**
1. Go to **Settings → Network → Mobile Hotspot** and turn it on
2. Connect your phone to your PC's hotspot
3. Run `portdesk-server.py` — the IP shown in the terminal will be your hotspot IP
4. Open that IP in your phone's browser

**Android tethering mode (reverse):**
1. Enable USB tethering on your phone
2. Run `adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000`
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` on your phone

---

## HTTPS Setup (required for microphone)

The mobile microphone feature requires a secure connection (HTTPS).

```bash
python gen_cert.py     # generates cert.pem and key.pem
python portdesk-server.py   # auto-detects the certificates and starts HTTPS
```

Then use `https://` instead of `http://` when opening on your device.  
Accept the self-signed certificate warning in the browser.

##  Security & Whitelist

PortDesk is designed for local network use only. It has a built-in IP whitelist system.

**How it works:**
- When a new device tries to connect over WiFi, the server prints a prompt in the terminal asking you to allow or deny it
- Type `y` to add the device to the whitelist, `n` to reject
- The whitelist is saved in `portdesk_security.json`
- Whitelisted devices connect automatically in the future

**Manage the whitelist from the phone:**
- Settings → Add this device to whitelist (adds current phone)
- Settings → Clear whitelist (reset — all devices must re-request access)

**PIN Lock:**
- Settings → Set PIN — set a 4-digit PIN
- Anyone opening the URL must enter it before accessing the controller
- PIN is stored as a salted SHA-256 hash in the browser, never sent to the server in plain text
- After 5 wrong attempts, the server locks the IP for 60 seconds

## 🔊 Remote Audio & Microphone

### Remote Audio (PC → Phone)
Streams your PC's audio to your device in real-time.

**Windows:** Requires [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).  
Set your app's audio output to "CABLE Input". PortDesk reads from "CABLE Output".

**Linux:** Uses PulseAudio — no extra software needed.

### Microphone (Device → PC)
Uses your device's microphone as a virtual mic on the PC.

**Windows:** Requires VB-Audio Virtual Cable. PortDesk outputs to "CABLE Input".  
**Requires HTTPS** (see HTTPS setup above).

## A note on development

PortDesk was built with the assistance of AI tools. This is mentioned in the spirit of transparency — the architecture, decisions, and direction were by me, but AI was used throughout the development process for code generation, debugging, and documentation.
