### What is PortDesk?
PortDesk transforms any device into a PC controller. It works seamlessly over your local network (Wi-Fi or USB) or via the internet—allowing you to control your computer by simply opening a URL in any web browser.
## ⚠️ Official Source

**The only official and verified release of PortDesk is hosted at:**  
👉 `https://github.com/Lucky-abdo/PortDesk`

Copies or forks obtained from third-party websites, messaging groups, or unofficial links may have been modified. We cannot guarantee that such versions retain the same privacy standards, security model, or integrity as the original. Please exercise caution and always verify the source before running any code on your machine.

### Lazy to read ?
give this prompt to ai
```bash
Read the following PortDesk documentation and give the user a clear, concise summary covering only: what PortDesk is, how to install it, how to run it, and the most important notes (HTTPS for mic/gyro, FFmpeg for H264 streaming, dxcam for best Windows performance, PIN security, whitelist system). Skip detailed platform troubleshooting and feature descriptions. Be brief.

--- PASTE DOCUMENTATION BELOW ---
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

[requirements](requirements)


### 2. Run the server

```bash
python portdesk-server.py
```

> **Recommended:** Use the start file for best results — on Windows use `start_portdesk.bat`, on Linux/macOS use the matching shell script. This prevents focus issues with keyboard input.

You'll see something like:
```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  🎮 PortDesk v1.0
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  [USB]  adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000 → http://localhost:5000
  [WiFi] http://192.168.1.x:5000
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 3. Open on any device

- **WiFi:** Open `http://192.168.1.x:5000` in any browser on any device on the same network
- **USB (Android):** Run `adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000` first, then open `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Connection Modes

### Hotspot Mode (no router needed)
You can use PortDesk without any WiFi router by creating a hotspot directly from your PC.

**Windows:**
1. Go to **Settings → Network → Mobile Hotspot** and turn it on
2. Connect your phone to your PC's hotspot
3. Run `portdesk-server.py` — the IP shown in the terminal will be your hotspot IP
4. Open that IP in your phone's browser

**Android tethering (reverse):**
1. Connect your phone via USB
2. Enable USB tethering on your phone
3. Run `adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000`
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` on your phone

> Hotspot mode works with zero internet — the connection stays local between your PC and your device.

### WiFi Mode
- Connect your device and PC to the same WiFi network
- Open the IP shown in the terminal on any browser
- Works from phones, tablets, laptops, other PCs — anything with a browser

> **Make sure you are on the main network, not a guest or mobile data network.**

### USB Mode — Android
Requires [ADB (Android Debug Bridge)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) installed on PC.

```bash
# Enable USB Debugging on your Android device first, then:
adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` on your device.

> For non-Android devices (iPhone, iPad, laptop) just use WiFi mode — USB mode is Android-specific.  

---

## 🌐 Remote Access (Internet)

PortDesk operates in **two layers** automatically:

| Layer | Mechanism | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Direct WebSocket (LAN/USB) | Same network — always tried first |
| 2 | WebRTC + STUN (P2P) | Different networks — auto-fallback |

Layer 2 uses free Google STUN servers and requires no installation. It will work if neither device is behind double-NAT (CGNAT). If it fails, see the options below.

---

### Going beyond STUN — using a VPN tunnel

If STUN fails (common with mobile data or ISP CGNAT), the recommended approach is a VPN overlay tool. These create a virtual LAN between your devices, making PortDesk work exactly as if both were on the same WiFi — no code changes needed on either side.

**Recommended: NetBird** (open-source, self-hostable, stronger security model)
- Download: https://netbird.io
- Install on both PC and phone, sign in with the same account
- Use the NetBird IP shown in the dashboard instead of your LAN IP

**Alternative: Tailscale** (easier setup, same concept)
- Download: https://tailscale.com
- Install on both devices, sign in
- Use the Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) instead of your LAN IP

> **Note on MTU:** Both tools use a slightly reduced MTU (~1280–1400 bytes) to accommodate encryption headers. PortDesk's upload and streaming code handles this transparently via chunked I/O — no manual configuration needed.

> **Security note:** PortDesk's whitelist system uses the tunnel IP. Add it once via Settings → Add this device to whitelist.

---

## HTTPS Setup (required for microphone)

The mobile microphone feature requires a secure connection (HTTPS).

```bash
python gen_cert.py     # generates cert.pem and key.pem
python portdesk-server.py   # auto-detects the certificates and starts HTTPS
```

Then use `https://` instead of `http://` when opening on your device.  
Accept the self-signed certificate warning in the browser.

## Having an issue?

Check **`notes.txt`** first — it covers common problems, platform-specific fixes, CLI flags, PIN/pattern recovery, TOFU certificate warnings, and streaming troubleshooting. Most questions are answered there.


## Features

### 🖱️ Touch Tab — Touchpad & Mouse
- Move finger = move mouse
- Tap = left click
- Long press = right click
- Two fingers = scroll
- Scroll buttons on the side

### 🌀 Gyroscope Mouse
Press the **🌀 Gyro** button to use your device's physical tilt (mobile/tablet) as mouse movement.
- **Calibrate (🎯):** Sets the current phone angle as "center"
- **Sensitivity:** Adjustable in Settings
- **Dead Zone:** Minimum tilt before movement registers

### 🧠 AI Gyro Learning
Press **🧠 AI** to enable the AI sensitivity calibration system.  
It watches how you move and automatically adjusts gyro sensitivity and dead zone to match your natural hand movement style.  
The more you use it, the more accurate it gets.  
Your learned profile is saved in the browser and survives page refreshes.  
Reset it anytime from Settings → AI Gesture Reset.

### ⌨️ Shortcuts Tab

##  Security & Whitelist

**How it works:**
- When a new device tries to connect over WiFi, the server prints a prompt in the terminal asking you to allow or deny it
- Type `y` to add the device to the whitelist, `n` to reject
- The whitelist is saved in `portdesk_security.json`
- Whitelisted devices connect automatically in the future

**PIN Lock:**
- Settings → Set PIN — set a 6-digit PIN, or use Set Pattern for a gesture-based lock
- Anyone opening the URL must enter it before accessing the controller
- PIN is verified server-side using bcrypt. A SHA-256 hash is also stored locally in the browser for offline lock functionality
- After 5 wrong attempts, the server locks the IP for 60 seconds (escalating: 60s → 180s → 300s)

**Manage the whitelist from the phone:**
- Settings → Add this device to whitelist (adds current device)
- Settings → Remove myself from whitelist (removes only your own device — no device can remove others)

## 🔊 Remote Audio & Microphone

### Remote Audio (PC → Phone)
Streams your PC's audio to your device in real-time.

**Windows:** Requires [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).  
Set your app's audio output to "CABLE Input". PortDesk reads from "CABLE Output".

**Linux:** Uses PulseAudio — no extra software needed.

### Microphone (Device → PC)
Uses your device's microphone as a virtual mic on the PC.

**Windows:** Requires VB-Audio Virtual Cable. PortDesk outputs to "CABLE Input".  
**Requires HTTPS** (see HTTPS setup above).

## Known Limitations

- Screen mirroring FPS depends on your network speed and PC performance
- H264 streaming requires FFmpeg installed in PATH — falls back to JPEG automatically without it
- Mobile microphone requires HTTPS (generate a certificate first)
- Remote audio on macOS has limited support
- Gyroscope on iOS requires user permission (browser will ask on first use)
- Win key shortcuts (Win+D, Win+L, etc.) may not work if the server terminal window has focus — minimize it or use the `.bat` launcher

## A note on development

PortDesk was built with the assistance of AI tools. This is mentioned in the spirit of transparency — the architecture, decisions, and direction were by me, but AI was used throughout the development process for code generation, debugging, and documentation.
