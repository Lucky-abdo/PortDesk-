## What is PortDesk?

PortDesk turns any device into a full PC controller over your local network (WiFi or USB).  
No installation needed — just open a URL in any browser.  
Everything runs **locally on your machine**. Nothing is sent to the internet. Ever.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. System Requirements:

Python: 3.8 or higher.

OS: Windows 7+ / Linux (Ubuntu, antiX, Debian).

macOS: Version 10.14 (Mojave) or later.

Installation:  pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2. Run the server

```bash
python portdesk-server.py
```

You'll see something like:
```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  🎮 PortDesk v1.0
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  [USB]  adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000 → http://localhost:5000
  [WiFi] http://192.168.1.x:5000
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 3. Open on any device

- **WiFi:** Open `http://192.168.1.x:5000` in any browser on any device on the same network
- **USB (Android):** Run `adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000` first, then open `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Connection Modes

### WiFi Mode
- Connect your device and PC to the same WiFi network
- Open the IP shown in the terminal on any browser
- Works from phones, tablets, laptops, other PCs — anything with a browser
- Slight latency possible over WiFi

### USB Mode — Android (fastest, zero latency)
Requires [ADB (Android Debug Bridge)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) installed on PC.

```bash
# Enable USB Debugging on your Android device first, then:
adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` on your device.

> For non-Android devices (iPhone, iPad, laptop) just use WiFi mode — USB mode is Android-specific.  
USB mode has near-zero latency and doesn't need WiFi.

---

## HTTPS Setup (required for microphone)

The mobile microphone feature requires a secure connection (HTTPS).

```bash
python gen_cert.py     # generates cert.pem and key.pem
python portdesk-server.py   # auto-detects the certificates and starts HTTPS
```

Then use `https://` instead of `http://` when opening on your device.  
Accept the self-signed certificate warning in the browser.

## Features

### 🖱️ Touch Tab — Touchpad & Mouse
- Move finger = move mouse
- Tap = left click
- Long press = right click
- Two fingers = scroll
- Scroll buttons on the side

### 🌀 Gyroscope Mouse
Press the **🌀 Gyro** button to use your device's physical tilt (mobile/tablet) as mouse movement.
- **Calibrate (🎯):** Sets the current phone angle as "center"
- **Sensitivity:** Adjustable in Settings
- **Dead Zone:** Minimum tilt before movement registers

### 🧠 AI Gyro Learning
Press **🧠 AI** to enable the AI sensitivity calibration system.  
It watches how you move and automatically adjusts gyro sensitivity and dead zone to match your natural hand movement style.  
The more you use it, the more accurate it gets.  
Your learned profile is saved in the browser and survives page refreshes.  
Reset it anytime from Settings → AI Gesture Reset.

### ⌨️ Shortcuts Tab

## 🐛 Debug Console

The **`PortDesk v1.0 🐞`** logo in the top-left corner is a button.  
Tap it to open the debug console which shows:
- All socket events being sent
- Connection status and socket ID
- Any JavaScript errors
- Timing information

Use the **Client** tab in the Log panel for a formatted view of the same data.  
This is not just a logo — it is a live diagnostic tool.

---

## 🔒 Security & Whitelist

PortDesk is designed for local network use only. It has a built-in IP whitelist system.

**How it works:**
- When a new device tries to connect over WiFi, the server prints a prompt in the terminal asking you to allow or deny it
- Type `y` to add the device to the whitelist, `n` to reject
- The whitelist is saved in `portdesk_security.json`
- Whitelisted devices connect automatically in the future

**Manage the whitelist from the phone:**
- Settings → Add this device to whitelist (adds current phone)
- Settings → Clear whitelist (reset — all devices must re-request access)

**PIN Lock:**
- Settings → Set PIN — set a 4-digit PIN
- Anyone opening the URL must enter it before accessing the controller
- PIN is stored as a salted SHA-256 hash in the browser, never sent to the server in plain text
- After 5 wrong attempts, the server locks the IP for 60 seconds

## 🔊 Remote Audio & Microphone

### Remote Audio (PC → Phone)
Streams your PC's audio to your device in real-time.

**Windows:** Requires [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).  
Set your app's audio output to "CABLE Input". PortDesk reads from "CABLE Output".

**Linux:** Uses PulseAudio — no extra software needed.

### Microphone (Device → PC)
Uses your device's microphone as a virtual mic on the PC.

**Windows:** Requires VB-Audio Virtual Cable. PortDesk outputs to "CABLE Input".  
**Requires HTTPS** (see HTTPS setup above).

## notes

--PortDesk was built with the assistance of AI tools. This is mentioned in the spirit of transparency — the architecture, decisions, and direction were human-driven, but AI was used throughout the development process for code generation, debugging, and documentation. We believe honesty about how software is built matters.
